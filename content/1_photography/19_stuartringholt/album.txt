A mate took me to Ron and Karen's house in Scarborough. It was the first time we had met. The toilet was out the back and I went to take a wee. Strangely the floor was covered in newsprint - loose pages carpeting the small room. As I began to relieve myself piss began spraying in all directions everywhere but down the bowl and all over the newsprint. After a few seconds of panic and increasingly soggy newspaper I decided to shut off. As any man would know this is almost impossible to do. Once you start you just have to keep going and so I began pissing again in mild confidence that the bowl would receive. Fuck! Fuck! Piss continued to shoot in three or four streams everywhere. With about half a tank remaining I realized I would have to wobble as much as I could down the bowl. Job done I stood in shock and embarrassment at my predicament.<br><br>The room was covered in piss. I may as well have kept the toilet seat down and turned in circles. It looked like a pub's toilet at closing. What the hell was I to do with all this piss soaked newsprint? There was too much to flush. If there wasn't the newsprint I could simply wipe everything down with toilet paper. What the fuck was newsprint doing spread over the floor like carpet? Why the hell had piss shot in so many directions?<br><br>I looked down at the end of my dick. To my astonishment a single hair had welded itself stage centre over the eye of it. Time to face the music. I gathered up the soggy newsprint into one big ball and wiped down the toilet as best I could. Hesitantly I made my way to the kitchen where Ron was standing and asked for the bin.<br><br>It seems the toilet has been the richest ground for embarrassing myself as a year or two later I again suffered, yet more severely. It was the weekend and I drove down the street to pick up Daryl. I was early so I crossed the road to the sports ground that overlooked the sea. A game of football was in progress and a big crowd was gathered on the grassy hill. I walked through the crowd stopping occasionally to watch the game. I continued on past a group of teenagers drinking booze out the back of their panel-vans and down the hill to pitch level.<br><br>When I was at the goals about fifty metres from the group of teenagers (hardly anyone was on the actual oval) one of them yelled out \"hey mate\". I couldn't quite hear correctly so I didn't turn around and continued walking. Again there was more yelling. I stopped and turned my head to hear, \"Hey mate you have dunny paper hanging down your pants\" peppered with group laughter. I initially thought they were joking and wanted me to look down at non-existent toilet paper. the 'made you look, you dirty chook' gag. So, I didn't check my pants and continued walking. By this time I was in shock as I knew I had been to the toilet before jumping in the car. I was petrified to look down at the back of my pants. I was keeping my dignity. I eventually did after walking another fifty metres. The young kid wasn't joking as there was a fifty centimetre torn strip of toilet paper dangling down the back of my pants. It was a long, torn, double ply strip, straight down the middle. I tugged at it to remove it. It was pretty well stuck to my arse. I felt mauled and bloody, ill in fact. I disentangled the paper not looking up at the crowd, completed the lap of the oval and returned to the car to pick up Daryl. A few days later I recounted the story to her. She laughed.<br><br>I too laugh as I recount these stories. At the time, the dangling paper incident had a profound effect on me. I remained shaken a week later. Why did I feel so destroyed and beaten? I no longer wanted to feel like this again so I did something about it anook it upon myself to intentionally embarrass myself to combat whatever it was that made me feel this way.</p><p>Several months after the toilet paper embarrassment I found myself travelling Italy and Switzerland promoting my work to art galleries. At the start of the trip I bit the bullet and began my research project of embarrassing myself. It was a Saturday and I stood with toilet paper dangling from my pants again at Florence's well touristed Palazzo Vecchio. I stood in front of a large fountain adorned by a figurative stone sculpture for twenty minutes while a fellow traveller discreetly photographed the event.</p><p>I didn't want to repeat the situation. It took some courage. Paul, my mate who took the photographs, seemed as perplexed or affected by the whole thing. During the twenty minutes I really just wanted it to end although there were moments when I closed my eyes and just concentrated on my breath. These feelings were mixed with relief as the action was underway. It ended the anxiety that I felt in the preceding week of knowing that I would be embarrassed again.</p><p>After taking the pictures Paul waited and observed the reactions of the passing crowd.</p><p>About six or eight people noticed the paper with a couple of great double takes amongst them. No one tapped me on the shoulder. We both had a good laugh and a coffee afterwards.</p><p>Over the next year I continued the project by wearing snot on my face, white thread in my beard, a red texta mark on my cheek, chewing a pen on a train so that green ink went all over my lips and teeth, wearing an \"I am stupid\" post it note on my back, a small piece of rubbish on my beanie, a jumper with a large op shop price tag hanging off the back, a big apple down the back of my speedos at the public pool and a plastic prosthetic nose over my good one. I schemed other ways to embarrass myself vet the practicalities of making the actions look natural discounted them. They were all difficult to do. Wearing the price tag was as masochistic and unsettling as the best of them yet it was the most revealing.</p><p>The week before wearing the tag I met a woman on a tram whilst returning home. We spoke for five or so minutes and I missed a stop because of the meeting. As I was getting off the tram I thought to give her my phone number yet as usual I was shy. I became a little mad at myself for being like this. When I arrived home I put pen to paper asking the girl out for coffee. This was very bold for me yet I thought I'd give it a go. I remembered she worked at the Institute for Chemical Engineers and simply addressed it to the firm (they didn't have many staff). As a result two days later I got a call and we had lunch the next day. We got on well and arranged to meet again. Excited, I took her some dinner and we were up all night. At 5 am we tried to sleep after shagging.&nbsp;</p><p>At 7 am we were out of bed and getting ready for work. I drove home. Once in the door I made the decision to wear the jumper with the price tag right there and then. I remember thinking that it would be easier in this sleep-deprived state. It was 9 am and I was on a tram down to the shops monitoring how I felt. It was mildly nauseating. Tended up at a Hawthorn post office and did some photocopying as my back would be facing staff and customers. No one told me the tag was attached. I collected my mail and caught the tram home. My neighbour took some photos of me at the tram stop with the tag.</p><p>People's reluctance to inform me of my predicament was constant for the entire research project. Were they being respectful and mindful of my impending embarrassment by not telling me or is it simply not such a big deal for the public? Recently I noticed a woman in the city with a tissue stuck to her bum. I didn't think too much of it or inform her. The woman in tights at a supermarket with a fifty-cent size moisture ring at her sphincter was another thing. I didn't inform her either.</p><p>Months later when I was thinking about the course of events of the clothing tag and the one night stand, I came to an important realization about my body and how I related to women. What I realized was that the sickness I felt in my stomach when courting women was very similar to the sickness I was feeling when I was embarrassed. Through correlating the feelings I discovered that I feared women! I was debilitatingly shy! I now understood why I never had much luck with girls (only two girlfriends up to age 30). I had a fear I wasn't good looking, a fear of further rejection and a fear of feeling physically ill in the stomach when I thought about ringing a girl to ask her out.</p><p>Undertaking the research project had, in a way, freed me to approach women without the fear. I began to approach this type of situation with the attitude of \"so what if she doesn't like me - I am not going to be embarrassed by her rejection - if I can intentionally wear toilet paper and snot I can do this \" and \"women won't ask you out, you have to do it or go without - it is that simple\" The project got us both laid and I laugh about the psychological madness that I had been living with. Many male musicians respond to the question of why they got into a band with \"to meet girls\" \"Conceptual artist meets girl.\" reads headline. Art had quite literally changed my life and if there is anything to be proud about my arts career it is this.</p><p>Becoming less fearful about things as you grow older might, in the majority of cases, be the natural progression without my brand of research. I feel certain that confronting fears quite literally makes for a healthier and happier life and that the research helped bridge the gap between my loneliness and happiness. Paul, the photographer, is still a good friend. When I returned to Australia and Daryl left me I moved to Melbourne. Paul gave me a bed for two weeks and took me to the football. Lanie was at the game. A year later we are still in love.</p><p><strong><em>Stuart Ringholt 2003</em></strong></p>"},"id":"3e63c3b6-9d99-43fb-82ed-852ea99ea8b0","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"<p>Embarrassed, 2003<br>Pallet of 20 Minuten newspapers with artist’s<br>1/4 page advertising<br>100 x 75 x 70 cm</p><p>On Wednesday he wore a plastic nose, 2003<br>8 hour performance<br>Basel, Switzerland<br>Photo: Mark Miele<br>Ilfochrome polyester photograph 120 x 80 cm<br>Edition 3/7 signed verso</p><p>Funny Fear Workshop, 2004<br>Book<br>Edition 45 + 4 s.p + 2 a.p<br>30 x 42 cm</p><p>Conceptual Art Improved My Embarrassing Life, 2003<br>Newspaper<br>Edition 20 + 2 a.p<br>24 x 32 cm</p><p>On Saturday he chewed a pen getting ink all over his lips and teeth, 2002<br>20-minute performance<br>Perth to Fremantle train, Western Australia<br>Photo: Mathew Grigsby<br>Ilfochrome polyester photograph 76 x 50 cm<br>Edition 1/6 signed verso</p><p>On Thursday he wore a booger in his beard, 2002<br>20–minute performance<br>Centrelink Armadale Office Perth Western Australia<br>Ilfochrome polyester photograph 76 x 50 cm<br>Edition 1/6 signed verso</p>"},"id":"6cedd23c-5b59-46ba-8067-7026d5cbbbb8","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["file://Qb0tGC63X1pU3qH1"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"On Thursday he wore a booger in his beard, 2002<br>20–minute performance<br>Centrelink Armadale Office Perth Western Australia<br>Ilfochrome polyester photograph 76 x 50 cm<br>Edition 1/6 signed verso","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"76ba2e0f-08e2-4a13-960d-0f34d27cf63a","isHidden":false,"type":"image"}]
