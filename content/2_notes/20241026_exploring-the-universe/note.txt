Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by <strong>their</strong> place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.</p>"},"id":"_MtYF6qOmq","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"web","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxOzgCojM6E","video":[],"poster":[],"caption":"","autoplay":"false","muted":"true","loop":"false","controls":"true","preload":"auto"},"id":"67d1e553-ce98-45b8-947e-01a7f0e8faf4","isHidden":false,"type":"video"}]
